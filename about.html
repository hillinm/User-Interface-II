            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my "About me" page.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was raised in Portland, Oregon.   After high school, I joined the US Coast Guard stationed in Seattle, Washington. After serving, I moved down to Portland Oregon and attended Portland State University</p>
            <br>
            <p>I graduated with a Bachelor's in Geography.  Two months after graduation, I was offered a job in Colorado Springs, Colorado working with aerial photograpy.  Two years later, I accepted a position in St. Louis, Missouri with a satellite imaging company. Then 9/11 hit and I knew the future of our industry was changing.  I immediately started applying to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. In 2006, I began my career as an Intelligence Officer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2007, I deployed for the first time to Baghdad, Iraq.  Over the next six years, I did seven deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Japan.  My career has taken me to every corner of the earth.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I currently support the US Air Force at Scott AFB, Illinois and again, our industry is changing. In 2019, I attended a 13 week course at LaunchCode. The love I have for coding has driven me to pursue an education from Lambda.</p>
